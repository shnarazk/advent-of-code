### Usage

```
# at the top of the working tree of this repository
$ bqn/2022/dayDD.bqn data/2022/input-dayDD.txt
```

You may be able to omit the date file.

```
$ bqn/2022/dayDD.bqn
```

For some program, you need to use `$PWD` to get an absolute path:

```
$ bqn/2022/dayDD.bqn $PWD/data/2022/input-dayDD.txt
```
